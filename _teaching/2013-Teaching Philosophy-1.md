At the heart of my teaching philosophy is the integration of research into the classroom to inspire and engage students in the field of economics. For example, in my "Labor Economics" course, I illustrate how traditional theories serve as a robust foundation for contemplation and investigation, while also highlighting their limitations, thereby paving the way for further research opportunities. I exemplify this by presenting insights from my current paper on price regulations, contrasting it with conventional theories on price controls.
Moreover, I strive to make economic concepts more relatable and memorable by connecting them to real-life phenomena and using analogies. In my "Money & Banking" class, I elucidate the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy with a vivid analogy: comparing interest rates to the height of a dam's floodgates, and the money supply to the flow of water. This approach helps students, especially those who are not majoring in economics, to better understand and retain complex economic ideas.


<p>The pass rate in my classes has been 100% as opposed to the usual 75-80% for instructors who taught before me. I achieved this by demonstrating concepts through real life examples and giving enough problem practice to the students, which ensured better retention. I believe that failure of a student is failure of the instructor. There have been students in my class who were battling health concerns, have been going through the pain of losing someone from their families or having big responsibilities such as having to take care of a sick family member, or students from lower socio-economic backgrounds working multiple jobs and managing the tough workload from school, all at the same time. The grading is structured optimally to prevent such students from flunking, while also being fair enough by rewarding the students who might not have had such problems, yet did well in the class. The aim is to improve their understanding of concepts and their confidence, which would help them in their job search and life, rather than penalize them for their disadvantages.<p> 


<p>I believe in keeping the classes fun and interactive, so that there is active involvement of all students and no students feels left out. Here's a snapshot of how being in my classes is like:<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z7hic0s6u9zdi47uuk3ey/Announcements-AECO350-Money-and-Banking-1413-UAlbany.pdf?rlkey=asbe7ehx25xgybo8raud8q7ge&st=w5td6n8f&dl=0" target="_blank">AECO-350-Announcements</a><p>
