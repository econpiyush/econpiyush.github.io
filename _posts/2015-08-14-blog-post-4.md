# Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency for improving our public health infrastructure through investments in expansion of a skilled workforce for future needs. Recently, there has been increased funding into the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund and the American Rescue Plan, and these resources are being used towards workforce development activities. For the development of the public health workforce, it is essential to define it, to track it, to know the current efforts to track it and to identify the challenges in doing so. Thus, in this rapid response study on public health workforce, we identify how the "public health workforce" is defined in the current literature, identify the barriers to tracking this workforce, determine what existing data sources exist and note any current efforts to track or quantify it.

# Introduction

The public health workforce is indeed essential and the need to recruit, train, and develop a new generation of leaders, who can respond to the nation’s public health needs, is ever present. Specifically, strong public health systems are the first line of defense in a well-functioning health care system. For our nation’s health care system to function in an effective way, we must have skilled and well-supported public health and health education workers (Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework, 2016).

For decades, workforce development has fallen behind due to underinvestment and decreased funding, particularly to our local and state health departments (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), 2021). As a result, the nation faced serious consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic; including, insufficient systems for data assessment and monitoring of workforce needs and critical need for more diverse public health and health education workers that can serve our diverse communities. Thus, the public health workforce needs development and support is needed to effectively collect and analyze workforce data on our future needs and to evaluate evidence-based programs for expansion of successful initiatives. Thus, it is imperative to define and track the public health workforce as accurately as possible in order to gauge optimal response during not just pandemic and public health emergencies but at other times too, since public health is an ongoing quest.

# Identifying how public health workforce is defined in the current literature

Public health workforce is a broad term and encompasses a diverse range of professions, settings, and focuses. In order to define and track the public health workforce, is it essential to know what constitutes public health. 

In 1920, Charles-Edward A. Winslow defined public health as "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical health and efficiency through organized community efforts for the sanitation of the environment, the control of community infections, the education of the individual in principles of personal hygiene, the organization of medical and nursing service for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of disease, and the development of the social machinery which will ensure to every individual in the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health."

As opposed to medical care which focuses on an individual, the focus of public health is “population” (Gebbie et al 2002). CDC foundation defines public health as “the science” of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities. This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, researching disease and injury prevention, and detecting, preventing and responding to infectious diseases.

CDC foundation further elaborates on what public health professionals do. Public health professionals try to prevent problems from happening or recurring through implementing educational programs, recommending policies, administering services and conducting research—in contrast to clinical professionals like doctors and nurses, who focus primarily on treating individuals after they become sick or injured. This definition contrasts public health professionals with clinical professionals. The wider circle of professionals associated with public health includes almost all physicians, dentists, and nurses, plus many other health, environmental, and public safety professionals (Gebbie et al 2002). Public health also works to limit health disparities. A large part of public health is promoting health care equity, quality and accessibility.

# Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) definition

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) defines public health workers as all those responsible for providing the essential services of public health regardless of the organization in which they work. The 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHS) describe the public health activities that all communities should undertake. For the past 25 years, the EPHS have served as a well-recognized framework for carrying out the mission of public health. The EPHS framework was originally released in 1994 and more recently updated in 2020.

# Shortcomings of the DHHS definition

This definition is very broad in scope, and we lack sufficient data sources to allow for inclusion of the entire public health workforce as defined by DHHS (Strategies for Enumerating the U.S Governmental Public Health Workforce, 2012, pg. 11, para 1). At the same time, this definition doesn’t specify the precise requirements pertaining to the profession, setting, or focus of concern, which makes it hard to track or enumerate public health workforce and is thus prone to inclusion and exclusion errors.

# Three dimensions to define Public Health workforce

Gebbie et al (2002) in “The Public Health Workforce” don’t really attempt to redefine public health workforce but give the three dimensions based on which public health workers may be defined. Those dimensions are - specific profession (the worker), place of employment (the work setting), or focus of concern (the work).

## Shortcomings of the approach mentioned in Gebbie et al (2002)

A choice of any one of the dimensions given in Gebbie et al (2002) to classify or define public health workforce is problematic because these essentially share complex interdependence between each other. For instance, people belonging to different professions could work in the same setting while healthcare workers belonging to the same professions could work in totally different settings. Similarly, healthcare workers belonging to a specific profession might have a certain focus in a particular setting while other healthcare workers belonging to the same profession might have a completely different focus in the same or different setting.

A healthcare worker involved in a specific profession could be a public health worker by specialty (focus), while another healthcare worker involved in the same profession might not be a public health worker by specialty. For instance, a Registered Nurse (RN) could have acute/critical care, medical surgical care, public health or any other specialty as their “primary nursing position specialty”. Thus, a RN may or may not have “public health” as a primary nursing position specialty. As the table here from the 2020 National Nursing Workforce Survey, Journal of Nursing shows, even though public health specialty constitutes less than 2% of all specialties, the estimated population proportion is more than 40,000. Thus, blanket inclusion or exclusion of a profession could lead to significant inclusion and exclusion errors respectively, in enumerating public health workforce.

Similarly, if we are considering public health setting rather than a specialty, a RN may have “public health” as their “primary nursing practice position setting” while another RN might have a different primary nursing practice position setting such as hospital, community health, nursing home/extended care and so on. This is further complicated by the fact that a RN may have public health as their “secondary nursing practice position setting” while another RN may have a different secondary nursing practice position setting. Thus, as pointed out before, blanket inclusion or exclusion of a setting could lead to significant inclusion and exclusion errors respectively, in enumerating public health workforce.

At the same time, it is important to look at jurisdiction. Even while looking at jurisdiction, we still need to look at the focus. As pointed out before, community health professionals also work at CDC (federal jurisdiction), but their focus isn’t the same as public health professionals. In conclusion, while enumerating the public health workforce, it is important to take into consideration all the following - profession, setting or jurisdiction and focus of concern or specialty.

# NY State Department of Health occupational categories and focus

There have many attempts internationally as well as at state level in the U.S. to define, enumerate or classify public health workforce. One of the useful ones is by the NY State Department of Health, which is more specific as regards to the focus or activity of each of the public health employee. NYSDOH doesn’t really define public health but lists the professions with certain professions who need to have a specific focus to be classified as “public health employees”.

According to NYSDOH, the public health employees include:
1. Scientists who go out and track the source of diseases.
2. Nurses who administer vaccinations in clinics and conduct home visits to assist new babies.
3. Sanitarians, technicians and engineers who make sure certain restaurants are clean and drinking water is safe.
4. Nutritionists who develop recommendations for healthy eating.
5. Laboratory scientists who test water, foods and specimens for contamination.
6. Health educators who promote and improve health by teaching individuals, families, groups and communities how to assume responsibility for addressing health and healthcare issues.

NY state department of health mentions public health professionals separately and they include-health commissioners/directors, public health sanitarians, public health technicians or engineers, public health nurses, epidemiologists, public health educators, doctors, nutritionists, scientists and dentists.

## Shortcomings of the NYSDOH list

The NYSDOH list of public health employees and the tasks they should be doing and that of the professionals is specific. However, it doesn’t specify the settings or jurisdiction for these public health employees or professionals, which could make the task of tracking the public health workforce difficult. Moreover, the current data sources are limited to not allow us to track the public health workforce based on job focus.

# Public health workforce taxonomy

Public health workforce taxonomy is a standardized multi-axial taxonomy to facilitate the systematic characterization of every public health worker, and a set of minimum data elements to be incorporated into future public health workforce surveys by the University of Michigan Center of Excellence in Public Health Workforce Studies (UM CEPHS), supported by CDC and HRSA funding. The taxonomy is designed to improve the comparability among public health surveys collecting workforce data and assist with difficult enumeration problems, although identity resolution is not a specific feature of this taxonomy. The public health workforce taxonomy is not an attempt to develop a new set of standard occupational classifications for public health; rather, it serves as a tool for post-coordination of public health worker characteristics regardless of the differences in the occupational classifications applied (Boulton et al 2014). The 12 axes of the workforce taxonomy are occupation, workplace setting, employer, education, licensure, certification, job tasks, program area, public health specialization, funding source, condition of employment, and demographics.

# Case Definition Used by the 2010–2011 COE Project

The case definition tackles some shortcomings described above as well as some other challenges. It was drafted by the core teams from University of Michigan, University of Kentucky, CDC, and HRSA based on available data sources; NACCHO and ASTHO provided feedback on the draft. It is important to specify that the case definition focuses only on the governmental public health agencies - both public health as well as nonpublic health - at all levels viz. Federal, state, local. It excludes non-governmental agencies or public health professionals employed in private settings. This would make the task of enumerating or tracking the public health workforce much easier if properly coordinated with the survey organizations.

The case definition for a public health worker includes all persons responsible for providing any of the 10 Essential Public Health Services (defined earlier) who are employed in the following venues:
- Traditional nontribal state, territorial, and local governmental public health agencies/departments
- Federal agencies with a clear mandate to provide public health services
- Non–public health state, territorial, local, or federal governmental agencies providing environmental health services
- Non–public health state, territorial, local, or federal governmental agencies providing public health laboratory services

15 occupational classifications have been identified as part of the project case definition, to match the occupational classifications developed for ASTHO and NACCHO’s profile surveys. These are as follows:
1. Administrative or Clerical Personnel
2. Behavioral Health Professional
3. Emergency Preparedness Staff
4. Environmental Health Worker
5. Epidemiologist
6. Health Educator
7. Laboratory Worker
8. Nutritionist
9. Public Health Dentist
10. Public Health Manager
11. Public Health Nurse
12. Public Health Physician
13. Public Health Informatics Specialist
14. Public Information Specialist
15. Other Public Health Professional/Uncategorized Workers

The definitions of each of these classifications could be found in Appendix in Strategies for Enumerating the U.S. Governmental Public Health Workforce, 2012. This project used the occupational titles used in the Enumeration 2000 study, which used 55 occupational titles adapted by the Center for Health Policy (CHP) at Columbia University from a taxonomy of titles developed by HRSA’s Bureau of Health Professions. Selected categories were modified because of changes in the SOCs during the past decade, and categories were condensed or eliminated to 20 occupational categories. The occupational categories were grouped into 15 occupations because they were determined by consensus to be the prime data sources for this project and were developed through a structured data harmonization process.

## Shortcomings of case definition approach

The final classification in the case definition excludes important categories from the original 55 categories from 2000 Enumeration Study which are directly involved in delivering public health related care such as infection control/disease investigator and health planner/researcher/analyst and includes nearly all of the peripheral public health workforce or workers which are directly not involved in public health activities but rather in general activities meant to support the public health professionals such as all the clerical staff or administrators.

Although these classifications work well for state and local health department personnel, they are more difficult to apply to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) Occupational Series, which provides more specificity than the broad OPM categories used in Enumeration 2000.

Several of the public health workers are not included in the case definition approach. They are as follows:
1. Community Health Workers
2. Faculty and Students in Schools and Programs of Public Health
3. Public Health Workers in Private Settings
4. Medicaid Workers
5. School Health Workers
6. Public Health Workers Providing Clinical and Population Health Services
7. Tribal Public Health Workers
8. Volunteer Public Health Workers.
Several of the public health workers are uncounted or undercounted due to gaps in data collection. Gaps in data collection include the limited information about the tribal public health workforce (additional data sources should be identified) and the lack of data on multiple occupations in all industries. Overall, the biggest challenge with enumerating the public health workforce by using existing data sources is filtering out those who are not public health workers in the BLS data and reconciling discrepancies in counts from different sources to determine where workers are undercounted, overcounted, and double-counted (Strategies for Enumerating the U.S. Governmental Public Health Workforce, 2012, pg. 17, last para).

For physicians, the NACCHO and ASTHO surveys do provide a count of the FTE public health physicians, public health nurses, public information specialists and so on. But there is little clarity about categorizing other professions such as physician assistants, behavioral health staff, quality improvement specialist and so on. The 15th category among the categories of occupations in the case definition i.e. “Other Public Health Professional” or “Uncategorized Workers” is very open-ended and provides no clarity on who should and should not be included in this group. Thus, another challenge is to decide whether everyone in the public health setting be classified as a public health worker or not.

# Public health workers uncounted or undercounted in case definition approach

Public health workers uncounted or undercounted in the case definition approach are as follows:
1. Federal Non- civilian Employees
2. Contract Employees
3. State and Local Governmental Public Health Workers
4. Environmental Health Workers and Sanitarians
5. Laboratory Workers.

## Public health workers who are double counted in case definition approach are:

Public health workers who are double counted in the case definition approach are:
1. District of Columbia Health Department Workers
2. Federal Civilian Employees

The case definition mentioned above only marks the first phase of the public health workforce enumeration strategy which is slated to expand as data sources become refined and readily available. The first phase only identifies the “core” of the public health workforce for whom data is readily available. In phase II, the case definition would expand to focus on governmental workers for whom no workforce data source exists, CHWs employed in nongovernmental organizations, and public health faculty and students. The third phase of the case definition might include tribal public health workers and public health workers in private agencies and the health care system. Finally, the broadest phase of the case definition might capture the remaining sectors of the public health workforce that are more difficult to identify such as volunteer workers or CHWs not employed by an agency or organization, local boards of health members, and public health workers in schools).

# Barriers to tracking the public health workforce

The efforts to track the public health workforce have been hampered by a considerable lack of data about the public health workforce. Knowledge is limited regarding the workers the workforce comprises — how many workers populate it, what disciplines are represented, where workers deliver essential services, or how effective they are at doing so and the demographics of the workers (Strategies for Enumerating the U.S. Governmental Public Health Workforce, 2012, pg. 6, para 2).

Governance structures in public health systems are complex – some are centralized, and some are decentralized, with different jurisdictions. State workers have different functions than local and federal. So, defining, tracking or enumerating based on focus or function creates confusion.

The breadth of the field, its multidisciplinary nature, diverse settings for employment, and lack of applied standards for case definitions, worker classifications, or data collection methods are factors that make quantifying and characterizing this workforce difficult. Further, lack of a standardized national public health workforce monitoring system for collecting data in a systematic, consistent way has hampered researchers’ ability to develop reliable estimates. The lack of enumeration estimates jeopardizes the ability of public health leaders to understand workforce capacity, project trends, and develop policies regarding the future workforce. (Enumeration of the Governmental Public Health Workforce, 2014).
