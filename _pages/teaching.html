My teaching philosophy: I bring research into classroom. For instance, during my labor economics class, I explained how the conventional theories offer a great starting point and framework for thinking and research, yet they have certain limitations, which gives scope for further research. I demonstrated that by giving students an overview of my current paper on price regulations vis-Ã -vis the conventional theories on price controls. I also like to explain economic concepts using real life phenomena. For instance, in my "Money & Banking" class, I discussed the Fed Reserve's Monetary Policy using example of a dam, where the height of the flood gates is the inerest rates and the flow of water is the money supply.   


The pass rate in my classes has been 100% as opposed to the ealier 75-80%. I achieved this by giving enough problem practice to the students. I believe that failure of a student is failure of the instructor. There have been students in my class who have been going through the pain of losing someone from their families, battling health concerns or students from lower socio-economic backgrounds working multiple jobs and managing the tough workload from school, all at the same time. The grading is structured optimally to prevent such students from flunking, while also being fair enough by rewarding the students who might not have had such problems, yet did well in the class. The aim is to improve their understanding of concepts and their confidence, which would help them in their job search and life, rather than penalize them for their disadvantages. 


I believe in keeping the classes fun and interactive. Here's a snapshot of how being in my classes is like:<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z7hic0s6u9zdi47uuk3ey/Announcements-AECO350-Money-and-Banking-1413-UAlbany.pdf?rlkey=asbe7ehx25xgybo8raud8q7ge&st=w5td6n8f&dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>
