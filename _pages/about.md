Presented at AMES, 2024, and EEA (CSWEP), 2024. [Summary of Contributions](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gw2mrddljugt1yfmnb4a0/JMP_Contributions.pdf?rlkey=ei5fgowgz17orms5wsxq5ffcr&st=1kp29tg3&dl=0)

Abstract: The paper estimates the effects of Price Controls and Cost Controls on healthcare service quantity and their role in spatial
restructuring of physician market. Exploiting the quasi-experimental variation in regulatory-technological environment generated
by telehealth parity laws and broadband internet, I find that for aggregate sample and metro areas, Price Floor and Price Ceiling
have similar conducive effects, while Cost Parity has an unfavorable effect on service quantity and physician density, with these
effects amplified progressively with broadband. For non-metro areas, Price Floor and Price Ceiling have conducive effect on service
quantity and unfavorable effect on physician density, indicating efficiency gains.

Effect of Social Media Sentiments on Domestic and Foreign Stock Returns: A Machine Learning Approach - with [Ulrich Hounyo](https://sites.google.com/site/ulrichounyo/) 

Abstract: This paper predicts stock market performance using sentiment analysis from social media, powered by novel prediction
methods to measure prediction confidence. We examine how social media and news sentiment differentially impact foreign and
domestic stocks, enhancing the accuracy and trustworthiness of financial forecasts. Our approach groups similar stocks by financial
characteristics and pairs foreign stocks with their closest U.S. counterparts to analyze sentiment-driven performance differences. We
use Vector autoregression (VAR) to estimate impulse responses to financial uncertainty and changes in consumption aggregates.


[Medicaid Expansion: Key that Opens the Job Lock?]()

Abstract: I use search theory and triple difference-in-difference (DiD) design to study the impact Medicaid Expansion on job search
behavior and labor market outcomes. The preliminary analysis suggests that the effects of Medicaid expansion for the states which
expanded in 2014, on the likelihood of job desire, participation in the labor force, or engagement in full-time or part-time employment
are either statistically insignificant or very small. Among individuals with access to employer-sponsored health insurance (ESHI)
coverage, the expansion shows a strong positive impact on the desire for a job and labor force participation but a slightly negative
impact on both full-time and part-time employment. Specifically, the results show 6% less desire for job and 1.6% less labor market
participation among those with ESHI on average. The triple DiD estimates show that those with ESHI have a 2.5% more desire for
job than before (compared to those in non-expansion states without ESHI), indicating “on-the-job search” (OTJS). This provides
suggestive evidence that Medicaid Expansion released the job lock, as predicted by the search and matching framework.
