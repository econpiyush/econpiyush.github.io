Abstract: This paper estimates the effects of price controls and cost controls on healthcare service quantity and their role in the spatial restructuring of physician markets. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation from telehealth parity laws and broadband internet, I find that price floors and ceilings generally increase service quantity, while cost parity reduces it, with effects amplified by broadband access. In non-metro areas, these regulations improve efficiency by increasing quantity while reducing physician density.

**Regulating Physician Reimbursements and Consumer Out-of-Pocket Costs: Implications for Medicare Costs**  
**Under review – Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (submitted October 2025) · Solo-authored**

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of telehealth parity laws on Medicare costs, exploiting state-level variation in regulatory framing. Non-binding regulations (price ceiling and cost ceiling) reduce Medicare costs by preserving telehealth’s cost advantages and shifting more cost-sharing to consumers. Binding regulations (price floor and cost parity) have near-zero net effects. Cost-reducing effects diminish with higher broadband penetration. The findings highlight how technological and regional variation shape effective healthcare regulation design.

**Effect of Social Media Sentiments on Domestic and Foreign Stock Returns: A Machine Learning Approach** (with Ulrich Hounyo)

Abstract: This paper predicts stock market performance using sentiment analysis from social media and novel prediction-confidence methods. We show social media and news sentiment differentially affect foreign and domestic stocks and use clustering and VAR methods to trace impulse responses to financial uncertainty and consumption shocks.

**Medicaid Expansion: The Key that Opens the Job Lock?**

Abstract: Using search theory and a triple-difference design, I examine Medicaid expansion’s effect on job search and labor market outcomes. Preliminary results suggest small or insignificant effects on employment but suggestive evidence of increased “on-the-job search,” consistent with reduced job lock.
